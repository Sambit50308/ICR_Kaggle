Performed data cleaning and preprocessing and applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle imbalance in the data.
Performed variable selection using lasso penalized logistic regression by creating a relevance count of the predictors to identify the significant variables responsible for causing the health condition.
Built an Artificial Neural Network model using the predictors having a non-zero relevance count and obtained a better test recall score of 0.9213 as compared to 0.8764 obtained by both SVM and Random Forest algorithms.
